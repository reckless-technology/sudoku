# reckless-sudoku-<version>-linux-x64/ - the program, its end-user licence and the notices - in a tar.xz with every
# file's mode kept, so the program stays executable once unpacked, owned by no one in particular (root, numerically) and
# dated by SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH's or the last commit's time, so one stage makes one archive. Then the archive is held to
# the stage: unpacked into a folder of its own, every file the staged one byte for byte with its execute bits, and
# nothing else.
