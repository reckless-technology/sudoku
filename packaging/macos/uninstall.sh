# The macOS uninstaller's work, run as root by Uninstall Reckless Sudoku.app (packaging/macos/uninstall.applescript,
# which the installer carries in /Applications/Reckless Technology): what packaging/macos/make_installer.sh put on the
# Mac taken off it again, and nothing of the other Reckless products that share the folder -
#   - RecklessSudoku.app and this uninstaller in /Applications/Reckless Technology, and the folder when nothing else is
#     left in it;
#   - the end-user licence and the notices in /Library/Documentation/Reckless Sudoku;
#   - and the installer's three receipts (pkgutil --forget), so the system no longer counts the parts as installed.
# A bundle goes only when its identifier is the program's own (com.recklesstechnology.sudoku), so nothing else that
# happens to share a name is touched. The settings are the person's: the app removes them as the person, if asked. It prints
# how many bundles it took off.
#
# Usage (as root):  uninstall.sh
# RECKLESS_UNINSTALL_ROOT names a folder to stand for / (packaging/macos/test_installer.sh unpacks the package into
# one): the same removals under it, and the receipts left alone.
