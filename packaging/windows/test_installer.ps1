# The Windows installer installed and taken away again, on a runner whose service account may not write Program Files:
# a test build (make_installer.ps1 -TestRoot) installed silently for the current user under a folder of the test's own,
# every staged file checked at its place byte for byte, the installed program started there for a launch's check
# (RecklessSudoku.exe --smoke: its window opened, a few frames drawn, closed), installed again over itself as an
# upgrade, and the uninstaller leaving nothing of the program's - while two sibling products' folders beside it are left
# as they were.
#
#   pwsh -File packaging\windows\test_installer.ps1 -DistDir dist -Version 1.0.3 [-SkipLaunch]
#
# -SkipLaunch leaves out the launch's check, for a machine with no window station to draw on. The test build has an id,
# a name and a folder of its own and never reuses a previous install's folder, so it never meets a real install of
# Reckless Sudoku on the machine.
